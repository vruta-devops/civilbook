It’s not only what gets you safely from place to place on a daily basis, but it’s also the one that’s been with you through the family road trips, the late night drives, the good and the bad. That’s why your car deserves the right care.

If you’ve heard about ceramic coating, you may be wondering whether it’s right for your vehicle. After all, you’re super careful about what you lather onto your car’s surface. Luckily for you, this week’s car wash blog is here to help you out!

car wash offers a range of professional car detailing services for your vehicle, from interior detailing and traditional car washes to more speciality services such as paint correction and ceramic coating. Read this week’s car wash blog to learn more about our ceramic coating services and head on over to our Fredericksburg car detailer today!

What Is Ceramic Coating?
It seems that ceramic coating is the “next best thing” when it comes to car care, but what exactly is it? Well, let’s start with the basics. It’s a liquid polymer that’s hand-applied to the exterior of your vehicle. It chemically bonds with your vehicle’s factory paint, creating not only a solid layer of protection from everyday elements, but also, an unbeatable, glass-like shine.

What Does Ceramic Coating Do?
So, now you know that ceramic coating adds a hard, protective layer to your car’s paint that also makes it shine like it did the day you drove it off the lot.

But, wait, what kinds of things does it protect against?

- UV Damage/Oxidation
- Chemical Stains and Etching
- Typical Dirt & Debris (Hydrophobic Properties)
- And More

What Does Ceramic Coating Not Do?
When it comes to ceramic coating, there seems to be many myths circulating about what ceramic coating is capable of, so we’re here to clear it up for you.

While ceramic coating can do all those amazing things as stated above, it’s not a cure-all. Here’s what it can not do.

- Eliminate danger of scratches, rock chips, swirl marks, etc.
- Eliminate the risk of water spotting
- Eliminate the need to wash

Ceramic coating is capable of many great things, but it doesn’t allow you to completely slack off on car care altogether. It’s just a way of making your life easier by knowing that you’re doing all you can to protect your car from everyday elements that damage your paint each time you’re out on the road.

Should I Get Ceramic Coating for My Vehicle?
Again, ceramic coating isn’t a miracle solution, so there are limits to who should use it. If you keep your car in near-perfect condition, drive it regularly, but don’t neglect it, wash it often (and properly), and you’re looking for a way to cut down on washing time, then ceramic coating is definitely something you should consider.

However, if your car is a daily driver that might be a bit neglected, gets very dirty and isn’t washed right away, or is likely to be scratched or dented, you may want to consider other car detailing options or services.

The Bottom Line
All in all, ceramic coating is a fantastic way to protect your vehicle and restore its original, gorgeous shine. It’s a way to add value, make your life easier, and bring you peace of mind. NO more worrying about leaving your car out in the sun too long — your brand new ceramic coating will help combat the damage!',

I receive questions about the subject fairly often, so I sat down to compile my best tips for food bloggers and ended up with an even twenty. You’ll be more likely to develop a successful food blog if you follow these guidelines.

1. Be authentic.
Post about what you love and produce the best content you possibly can.

2. Don’t give up.
Blog growth is slow at first and gains momentum as time goes on, assuming that you stick with it and do your best.

3. Post original content.
If visitors like what you do, they will keep coming back for more.

4. Show your personality!
Enthusiasm is infectious, so don’t be afraid to show it. One of the coolest things about blogging is that you can connect with people who share your undying love for, say, avocado on toast.

5. Make friends and help each other.
In other words, network! Connect and cultivate friendships with other bloggers who share your interests. Leave thoughtful comments on their blogs, chat with them on social media and promote their content.

6. Make yourself accessible.
Be present and responsive on social media as best you can.

7. Keep your site design clean and easy to navigate.
Clutter detracts from your content.

8. Make it easy for visitors to follow your blog.
Place links to RSS/email subscription and social media prominently on each page.

9. Make it easy to comment on your blog.
No CAPTCHAs or required logins, please. Find a way to let your commenters know that they are appreciated, whether that’s by emailing them privately, responding to their comment publicly or by commenting on their blogs.

10. Make it easy to share your content.
Provide social media sharing buttons at the end of each post. Say thank you when others promote your work.

11. Post fantastic recipes only.
You don’t want visitors to invest their time and ingredients into a recipe and end up disappointed, right? Better to let the blog go quiet for a few days than to post a recipe you can’t stand behind.

12. Cite your sources.
Always. Not cool: reposting recipes verbatim, posting other bloggers’ photos without permission. Cool: original recipes, sharing links to your inspiration, linking to further resources on the subject at hand.',

                'description' => 'Termites may be tiny insects, but they can create enormous problems for homeowners. Referred to as “silent destroyers,” termites are wood-destroying pests that can rapidly damage the structural integrity of a home.

It’s important to understand what termites eat and what attracts them to a home to protect your property from them. Read on to learn about the diet of termites, signs of infestation, and what to do when you discover termites in your home.

What Do Termites Eat?
Termites eat wood and survive off the cellulose they find in their meals. Cellulose is a component found in plant cell walls. Termites can also eat other materials containing cellulose, such as paper, cardboard, and fabrics, but wood is their preferred food source.

While termites are associated with destruction to most humans, they are essential decomposers in nature. Termites help break down dead wood in forests and balance our earth’s ecosystems. However, termites quickly become a problem when they infest homes and structures made of wood.

Signs Termites are Eating Your Home
Termites are not always easy to detect but spotting them before they do too much damage is critical to protecting your home. The following are just a few signs that you might have a termite infestation:

Hollow-sounding wood:
If you tap on your floors or walls, and it sounds hollow, termites may have eaten away at the inside of the wood.

Mud tubes:
If you notice small, narrow mud tubes hanging from your ceiling or walls, it might be the pathway of termites.

Winged insects:
If you notice a tiny, winged insect around your home, it could be a swarmer. Similarly, you might find discarded wings, as termites shed their wings when they swarm.

Visible shelving on wooden surfaces:
If you notice what looks like horizontal or vertical lines of missing wooden material at baseboards or door frames, you may have termites. This damage is commonly referred to as shelving.

Structural weaknesses:
A sagging porch, a collapsing floor, and cracked paint can all be signs of termites at work.

It is important to remember that these signs could indicate another issue, such as water damage or an alternative pest. Only a professional pest control specialist can help you determine whether or not termites are the problem.

What Should You Do If You Think You Have Termites?
If you think you have termites, the best thing to do is act right away. The longer you leave a termite infestation unchecked, the more damage it will create.

Follow these steps:
Contact a pest control inspector who specializes in termites: A licensed and qualified pest control professional can inspect your home and determine if termites are the issue. They can then recommend the best treatment plan for your situation. Dodson Pest Control technicians are highly familiar with an extensive variety of wood-destroying pests and can help you identify a treatment plan.
Reduce moisture: Termites love moisture and need it to survive. Fix leaks and ensure that your crawlspace is well-ventilated to reduce the chances of attracting termites.
Get rid of wood debris: If you have piles of wood stacked up alongside your home, you could be inviting termites into your residence. Make sure to clear away wood debris and stack firewood at least 20 feet away from your house so any outside termites don’t migrate indoors.',

                'description' => 'When you’re driving a dirty car around and you finally reach that point where enough is enough, you may be tempted to look up your nearby car washes and just impulsively go to to the nearest one. But, before you pull out your phone and type “car wash near me,” consider the fact that choosing a car wash on the fly might not be the best idea.

Some car washes are better than others, and you’ll want to make sure you go somewhere that will give you quality service, and even more importantly, not compromise the quality of your car with cheap equipment.

Patience is a virtue. Next time you need a car wash, know that it’s worth the time to find a location that will do your car justice. Here are some things you should look for in a paid car wash:

Hand washing tools:

If you were to ask us, we don’t think that hand-washing is the best way to wash your car. However, that doesn’t mean it’s not useful. And if you want to give your car a true cleaning, it’s often helpful or even necessary to give it a little bit of your own personal touch.

We usually don’t recommend hand washes because, unless you’re a professional, it’s too easy to make mistakes that can actually be counterproductive.

In a DIY job, you might damage your paint job by [washing it in direct sunlight,]which is particularly true in Odessa, TX where the sun burns bright overhead. Or maybe you’ll use the wrong type of soap, or perhaps the wrong material, which can scratch your car’s finish. Maybe you didn’t use the right ratio to water and cleaner, leaving streak marks where you wiped it down. These are all risks you carry with an at-home job.

But, doing some hand-washing at a professional car wash is a great choice. First off, a good car wash will provide you with components that won’t damage your car. Second, a hand wash at a professional car wash is just preliminary to the automatic washing job.

Hand washing allows you to get down and dirty with some of the more stubborn details that an automatic wash might not be able to get by itself. Once you’ve gotten those with the power of good old scrubbing, you can run your car through the automatic wash which will take care of everything else — much faster and more efficiently than you could have on your own.

Foam brushes:

You have to put trust into the car wash that they’re providing components that won’t be bad for your car. Unfortunately, many car washes betray that trust, and use low-quality cleaners or machines that ultimately hurt your car in the long-term.

One of the biggest offenders (and most easy to recognize and therefore avoid) are cloth brushes and cleaners. It’s been shown that these can actually scratch your car’s coat. It’s hard to believe that a cotton cloth could do such a thing, but if you use one for long enough, the wear and tear will be visible.

It’s now recommended to use foam brushes instead of cloth, which have been proven to not leave your car with any damage. If you go to a car wash and they’re using cotton components to scrub your car, drive the other way!

While we can’t speak for other car washes, if you stop by Crazy Clean Car Wash, you’ll have the assurance that we only use the highest-quality materials to wash your car. If you’re anywhere in Odessa, Texas, there’s a good chance that one of our three car washes is nearby.

Car vacuum:

We always advocate taking a quick moment to stop and vacuum your car when you get the exterior washed. Why? Well, if you’re already taking time out of your day to wash your car, what’s the harm in taking just a few more minutes to put the car vacuum to work? Most people are highly unlikely to go home and do this on their own, so it’s good to just take care of it, and you will not only have a nice shiny exterior, but a clean and organized interior, leading to a driving experience that’s overall more stress-free.

Many car washes, including our Crazy Clean Car Wash locations, offer free vacuum usage. And look, it’s not like you have to go full [spring cleaning] on your car. Even just doing a quick pass over your car floors will be enough to prevent things from getting gross.

Options:

Finally, one of the best things you can encounter at a car wash is options. Sometimes, you only need a light wash that will cover the most basic cleaning. Other times, your car might be drenched with mud and gunk, requiring an extensive cleaning that utilizes premium products and features. Either way, it’s nice to have a car wash location that can accommodate different needs!

The other options that are good to have are [monthly passes.]Why stress about the cleanliness of your car, when you could just [sit and relax] while you drive through an automatic car wash, each and every day? With our passes, you can get unlimited car washes, and it pays for itself in three visits!

Next time you’re in need of car wash services, make sure that you don’t just choose the one that’s most near you. At Crazy Clean Car Wash, we offer every single thing on this list to our Odessa clientele. Stop by today!',

Although I do enjoy foods with a little heat, I cannot tolerate things as hot as my husband likes his food. This easy pasta dish has just enough spice to be interesting but is not too spicy so that everyone in the family can enjoy it.

My brother recently came across an Italian recipe video online that used nduja, Gorgonzola mascarpone cheese, grappa, and a little cream to create a pasta sauce, and sent me the link so I could make this dish for him. I was a little concerned after seeing the list of ingredients that the pasta might be too rich, but actually, the heat of the nduja gives the dish lots of flavor while the other ingredients meld together perfectly. I eliminated the grappa, and used both Gorgonzola cheese and mascarpone cheese since we do not have a cheese locally that contains both these cheeses in one. Not having the exact quantities of the ingredients, I played around with them until I achieved just the right taste.

You could add additional nduja if you prefer more heat, or decrease the amount if you do not like things very spicy. I found however, that the mascarpone and cream mellowed the heat of the chili peppers perfectly. I knew that I’d like this pasta dish, but I honestly never thought that it would be as good as it actually was. I can see that this pasta dish will become a family favorite and that I’ll be making it often in the future.

Nduja is a spicy, spreadable pork product from Calabria. It is typically made with parts of the pig, such as the shoulder and belly, along with roasted peppers and a mixture of spices. Although nduja was only found in Italy until recently, it is now made by some American companies. It can be found in specialty food stores as well as online. (See links below recipe) We always have nduja in the refrigerator and enjoy it spread on grilled bread, tossed with hot pasta, or on pizza. Although nduja is spicy, it isn’t that hot, and in fact, even my grandkids enjoy it. You could use any type of pasta with this sauce, including long pasta such as spaghetti or linguini, as well as short pasta such as rigatoni or penne.

Recipe for pasta:

Instructions:

-Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

-While the water is heating, place the Gorgonzola, mascarpone, cream, nduja, and walnuts in a small pot over medium heat.
-Whisk the sauce ingredients frequently and just bring to a boil.
-Reduce the heat to a simmer and keep warm.
-Cook the pasta according to the package directions, then drain, reserving a small cup of the pasta water.
-Return the pasta to the pot, then pour the sauce over the pasta.
-Toss the pasta in the sauce, adding a little pasta water to thin the sauce as needed.
-Serve the pasta in individual bowls topped with some chopped parsley, offering the grated cheese at the table.',

                'description' => 'As a commercial property owner, it is crucial to maintain the aesthetic appeal of your building to attract customers and clients. One of the easiest and most efficient ways to achieve this is by repainting your property regularly. Repainting not only enhances the appearance of your property but also protects it from weather elements and wear and tear.

But how often should you repaint your commercial property? The answer to this question depends on several factors. In this article, we will discuss these factors and help you determine the right time to repaint your property.

Factors That Affect the Repainting Frequency
1. The quality of the existing paint: If the previous paint job was done with high-quality paint, it would last longer than low-quality paint.

2. The weather in your area: Weather elements like UV rays, wind, and rain can cause the paint to fade or peel off faster. So, if you live in an area with harsh weather conditions, you may need to repaint your property more frequently.

3. The type of business you run: If your business involves high traffic, like a restaurant or retail store, you may need to repaint your property more frequently to maintain its aesthetic appeal.

4. The colour of the existing paint: Lighter colours tend to fade faster than darker colours. So, if you have light-coloured paint on your property, you may need to repaint it sooner than if you had a darker colour.

5. The condition of the surface: If the surface of your building is damaged or has cracks, it may require more frequent repainting to maintain its appearance.

How Often Should You Repaint Your Commercial Property?
Based on the above factors, commercial painting companies recommend that you repaint your commercial property every 5-10 years. However, this is just a general guideline, and your property may require repainting sooner or later, depending on the specific factors.

To determine the right time to repaint your property, you should consider the following:

1. The condition of the paint: Check the condition of the paint on your property regularly. It may be time to repaint if you notice any cracks, peeling, or fading.
2. The appearance of your property: If the appearance of your property looks outdated or unattractive, it may be time to repaint.
3. The feedback from your customers: If your customers complain about the appearance of your property, it may be time to repaint.

That being said, not everyone moving to our beautiful state has had the exhilarating experience of driving in the snow.  Even our very own Colorado natives can struggle sometimes! Below, we will give you some important tips and tricks that will allow you to drive through the snow safely and comfortably!

Take your time.  Make sure you plan to leave for your location earlier than usual, accidents are more prevalent during the winter, and they often occur when people are rushing to get to their destination.

Maintain a greater distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.

Winter tires are almost a must - the next best thing is all-weather tires.  Tires can save your life on those passes!

Clear ALL the snow from your vehicle before taking on the road; snow can often impair your vision if your vehicle is not properly cleaned off.

Fill your vehicle with a strong anti-freeze concentration; this way it won’t freeze on your windshield.

Accelerate and decelerate slowly; rushing can cause you to slide.

                'description' => 'It’s been how long since you last painted your home’s exterior? As you come home from work day to day, you start to notice the color isn’t as vibrant as it once was. Concerned, you move in for a better look and see the paint is beginning to crack! There are noticeable chips and what appears to be a separation between the layer of paint and the material beneath.

It seems like it’s time to repaint your home’s exterior.

How Often Should You Repaint Your House’s Exterior?
The exact answer depends on the paint you used, the quality of the paint job, and the materials your home’s exterior is made of. However, a general rule of thumb is that your home’s exterior should be painted every 5 – 10 years.

It’s essential to explore how exterior paint adheres to different materials to better understand when your home’s exterior needs to be repainted.

Your home’s first line of defense against the elements, severe weather, and sun-fading is that first layer of paint. It quite literally is a defensive barrier that protects your home and extends its longevity.

Aluminum Siding – 5 Years:
If your home has aluminum siding, you’ll want to paint the exterior of your house every five years. You want flexible paint because aluminum siding, made of metal, expands and contracts with changing temperatures. You’ll need flexible paint that can withstand the stress. The best type of paint for aluminum siding is 100% acrylic latex paint.

Stucco – 5-6 Years:
With stucco walls, you’ll want to repaint your home’s exterior every five to six years. Stucco performs best in arid climates, where a professional paint job using high quality paint can last even up to ten years. However, most stucco will need to be repainted sooner due to moisture, cracking, chipping, and other signs of wear and tear on your stucco.

Elastomeric paint is the best option for painting your home’s stucco exterior. Its rubbery polymer material is excellent for effectively coating the porous, textured surface of stucco and other masonry surfaces.

Wood Siding – 3-7 Years:
Wood surfaces are not only susceptible to changes in temperature, but they are also vulnerable to fluctuations in moisture likely caused by high humidity. This is due to the cellulose that makes up much of the wood structure. Because of the relatively unstable nature of wood, wooden siding needs to be repainted every three to seven years.

These vulnerabilities make wood prone to warping over time, negatively impacting the paint’s adhesion to the wood’s surface. To counteract the instability of wood over time, professional painters use 100% solid acrylic latex emulsion paint on wooden siding.

This flexible paint can withstand the constant expansion and contraction of wood and is an effective preventative barrier against moisture.

Ways to Make Your Exterior Paint Last:

A paint job’s longevity largely depends on the techniques used and the weather conditions on the day the home’s exterior was painted. If painting your home’s exterior, make sure you:

- Fully clean and prime the surface.
- Wait for a mild, temperate day with temperatures between 60 and 85 degrees.
- Pick a day with minimal wind to prevent dirt, dust, and pollen from getting trapped in the paint.
- Use paints recommended by professional painters.
- Go one coat at a time, and use one more coat than you think you need.
- Preventative maintenance helps improve the longevity of your exterior paint job.',

With the region’s frequent rainfall, ensuring your gutters are clean and in good condition is essential. In this comprehensive guide, we will provide you with valuable insights and detailed steps to effectively clean and maintain your Washington State home’s gutters. By following these guidelines, you can safeguard your investment and maintain a safe and well-maintained property for years to come.

The Significance of Clean Gutters for Your Washington State Home:
To truly understand the importance of maintaining clean gutters, it’s essential to grasp the potential consequences of neglecting this crucial aspect of home maintenance. Clogged gutters can lead to an array of problems, including water damage to the foundation, basement flooding, roof leaks, and even landscape erosion. In Washington State, where rainfall is abundant, these issues can escalate quickly, putting your property at risk. By regularly cleaning and maintaining your gutters, you can prevent these problems and save yourself from the extensive and costly repairs they may necessitate.

Essential Tools and Safety Precautions:
Before embarking on the gutter cleaning process, it’s essential to gather the necessary tools to facilitate an efficient and safe operation. This includes a sturdy ladder, work gloves, a trowel or scoop for debris removal, a garden hose, a bucket or tarp for debris collection, a brush or scrubber for stubborn build-up, and safety equipment such as goggles and non-slip footwear. Additionally, ensuring your safety throughout the process is paramount. Proper ladder usage, secure footing, and having a helper on hand are crucial precautions to avoid accidents.

Step-by-Step Gutter Cleaning Process

Clearing Debris:
Begin by removing larger debris, such as leaves, twigs, and branches, using a trowel or scoop. Collect the debris in a bucket or onto a tarp to prevent mess and facilitate easy disposal. Take care not to damage the gutters while removing the debris.

Flushing Gutters:
Once the initial debris is removed, use a garden hose with a nozzle attachment to flush out any remaining dirt and small particles. Start from the end farthest from the downspout, ensuring the water flows freely through the gutters. This step helps identify any blockages or areas where water is not draining properly.

Checking Downspouts and Drainage:
Inspect the downspouts for any blockages or clogs. Use the hose to flush water down the downspouts, ensuring it drains properly away from the foundation. Persistent clogs may require a plumbing snake or pressure washer to clear. Ensure the downspouts are securely attached to the gutters and directed away from the house to prevent water damage.

Inspecting for Damage:
Take the opportunity during the cleaning process to carefully inspect the gutters for signs of damage or wear. Look for loose or sagging gutters, damaged joints or seams, and rust or corrosion. Address these issues promptly to prevent further damage and ensure proper functionality. Replace any damaged or worn-out parts as necessary.',
